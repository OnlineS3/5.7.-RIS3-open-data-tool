		<h2>About</h2>

		<p>
			Currently, open data tools are not widely used in non-publicly funded projects. However, the effective use
            of this tool, facilitates the tracking of project themes and topics in each region which maybe
            cross-referenced with S3 priorities. The data made available by the tool can be highly valuable in tracking
            progress towards defined objectives and vision, and to inform the RIS3 update process.

            The RIS3 Open Data Tool is a form of data repository that allows for a finely grained tracking of projects
            and initiatives implemented in each region with links to respective S3 priorities. Data is mined using an
            automated collection system which mirrors the CORDIS (Community Research and Development Information
            Service) database along with additional information extracted from project
            and coordinator websites.

		<ul class='dashed'>
            <li><i>Step 1.</i> Define a <strong>search term</strong> concerning a <strong>specialisation</strong> of interest, select relevant sources and apply filters to refine your search.</li>
			<li><i>Step 2.</i> Browse the results to <strong>analyse trends</strong> and potentially further refine your search.</li>
			<li><i>Step 3.</i> <strong>Bookmark</strong> and <strong>subscribe</strong> to projects and organisations to track the progress of projects and regional specialisations.</li>
